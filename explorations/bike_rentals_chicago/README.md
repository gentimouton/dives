This exercise involves a public dataset from Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/yingwurenjian/chicago-divvy-bicycle-sharing-data describing rides in a bike share program in Chicago over many years.

Determine the effect of temperature on bike trip counts and lengths, controlling for any relevant seasonality (at the most relevant timescales - use your judgement!) and customer segments. Make your case with the appropriate visualizations.

If you find the amount of data overwhelming, sampling ~100k rows randomly should give you good results.

Structure your efforts into two stages - an exploration stage where you identify the important variables with significant interactions, and a synthesis stage where you pick one or two patterns to organize your findings around.
