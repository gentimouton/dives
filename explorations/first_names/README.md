# EDA easy
- name diversity over time: tf-idf or Herfindahl-Hirschman index 
- word cloud of top names
- plot proportion of a name in a given year, by state, on map viz like geopandas
- plot number of Johns over time, grouped by region (east coast, midwest, ...)
- dig into the name "Mary" - #1 female name, 2x bigger than #2 Elizabeth

# EDA hard
- find names that suddenly surged in popularity
- https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/most-common-name
- are parents more "creative" with female names than male names? define name entropy? or herfindhal index
- YoY trends when lots of new names appear, 
- predict up-and-coming names in 2020 (build model on past years? prophet?)
