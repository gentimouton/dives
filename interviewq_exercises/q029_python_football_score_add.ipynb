    "# Question 29 - American Football Scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways we can score in American Football:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 point - After scoring a touchdown, the team can choose to score a field goal\n",
    "    2 points - (1) after scoring touchdown, a team can choose to score a conversion, when the team attempts to score a secondary touchdown or (2) an uncommon way to score, a safety is score when the opposing team causes the ball to become dead\n",
    "    3 points - If no touchdown is scored on the possession, a team can attempt to make a field goal\n",
    "    6 points - Awarded for a touchdown\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, let's assume the potential point values for American Football are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2 points - safety\n",
    "    3 points - only field goal\n",
    "    6 points - only touchdown\n",
    "    7 points - touchdown + field goal\n",
    "    8 points - touchdown + conversion \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a score value, can you write a function that lists the possible ways the score could have been achieved?\n",
    "For example, if you're given the score value 10, the potential values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    8 points (touchdown + conversion) + 2 points (safety)\n",
    "    6 points (only touchdown) + 2x2 points (safety)\n",
    "    7 points (touchdown + field goal) + 3 points (only field goal)\n",
    "    5x2 points (safety)\n",
    "    2x2 points (safety) + 2x3 points (only field goal) \n"
