    "## Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability can be defined recursively.\n",
    "Let `p` be the probability that the whole population dies out, given it started at 1 amoeba.\n",
    "- `p1` is the chance this one amoeba \"divides\" into 1 then dies: `1/4 * p`.\n",
    "- `p2` is the chance it divides into 2 then the 2 amoebas die: `1/4 * p^2` (2 amoebas have to independently die).\n",
    "- `p3` is the chance it divides into 3 then the 3 die: `1/4 * p^3`.\n",
    "- `p0` is the chance it dies in the first epoch: `1/4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the law of total probability: `p = p1 + p2 + p3 + p0 = p/4 + p^2 /4 + p^3 /4 + 1/4`\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means: `p^3 + p^2 - 3p + 1 = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorizing this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(p-1) (p^2 + 2p -1) = 0\n",
    "Delta = 4 - 4*(-1) = 8\n",
    "Roots are -2/2 +/- sqrt(8)/2 = -1 +/- sqrt(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3 roots are:\n",
    "1\n",
    "-1 + sqrt(2) = .414\n",
    "-1 - sqrt(2) = -2.414\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: the probability the population eventually dies out is 41%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
